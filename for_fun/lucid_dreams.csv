Words
I
have 
these 
lucid 
dreams 
where 
I 
can't 
move 
a 
thing
Thinking 
of 
you 
in 
my 
bed
You 
were 
my 
everything
Thoughts 
of 
a 
wedding 
ring
Now 
I'm 
just 
better 
off 
dead
I'll 
do 
it 
over 
again
I 
didn't 
want 
it 
to 
end
I 
watch 
it 
blow 
in 
the 
wind
I 
should've 
listened 
to 
my 
friends
Did 
this 
shit 
in 
the 
past
But 
I 
want 
it 
to 
last
You 
were 
made 
outta 
plastic 
(fake)
I 
was 
tangled 
up 
in 
your 
drastic 
ways
Who 
knew 
evil 
girls 
have 
the 
prettiest 
face?
You 
gave 
me 
a 
heart 
that 
was 
full 
of 
mistakes
I 
gave 
you 
my 
heart 
and 
you 
made 
heart 
break
